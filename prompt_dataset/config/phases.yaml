    dominant_grades: "JK–SK"
    tiers: [0, 1]
    description: >
      Symbol use is emerging but unstable. Thinking is perception-bound,
      focused on surface features, and limited to single-step causal chains.
      Rules are followed procedurally rather than conceptually. No reliable
      coordination of multiple constraints.

  - id: 1
    name: "Stable Rule-Based Reasoning"
    dominant_grades: "1–2"
    tiers: [2, 3]
    description: >
      Symbols become stable and manipulable under a single rule. Learners
      can perform short reversible operations and maintain simple
      multi-step sequences within one constraint. Reasoning remains
      concrete and breaks under multi-rule coordination.

  - id: 2
    name: "Relational System Coordination"
    dominant_grades: "3–5"
    tiers: [4, 5, 6]
    description: >
      Multiple relationships can be coordinated within a structured system.
      Learners track interacting constraints, understand nested categories,
      and engage in early proportional reasoning. Reasoning is relational
      but still grounded in concrete referents.

  - id: 3
    name: "Abstract Variable Reasoning"
    dominant_grades: "6–8"
    tiers: [7, 8, 9]
    description: >
      Variables detach from concrete grounding and become manipulable
      entities. Learners reason about unseen mechanisms, symbolic
      structures, and formal relationships. Hypothetical reasoning
      emerges but is not yet fully systematic.

  - id: 4
    name: "Systematic Hypothetical Construction"
    dominant_grades: "9–10"
    tiers: [10, 11]
    description: >
      Reasoning becomes combinatorial and possibility-space oriented.
      Learners deliberately vary variables, construct formal proofs,
      explore counterfactuals, and build structured abstract models.
      Assumptions within frameworks are typically unexamined.

  - id: 5
    name: "Meta-System Integration"
    dominant_grades: "11"
    tiers: [12]
    description: >
      Reasoning systems become objects of analysis. Learners compare
      competing frameworks, evaluate assumptions, analyze limits of
      evidence, and reconcile contradictions. Epistemic reflection
      becomes more stable but may remain domain-specific.

  - id: 6
    name: "Epistemic Synthesis"
    dominant_grades: "12"
    tiers: [13]
    description: >
      Multiple abstract systems can be integrated into coherent
      higher-order structures. Learners synthesize perspectives,
      reason about knowledge boundaries, and construct principled
      positions that account for competing models and uncertainties.
      Meta-cognitive monitoring becomes intentional and generalized.
